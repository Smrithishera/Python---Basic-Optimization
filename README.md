Basic Price Optimization
Price optimization is a strategic method that leverages data on sales, costs, competition, and market trends to forecast demand fluctuations and assess price elasticity. This approach enables businesses to establish ideal pricing. It includes competitive analysis to track market positioning, customer segmentation to understand different levels of price sensitivity, and the application of mathematical optimization algorithms to identify the most effective price points.
